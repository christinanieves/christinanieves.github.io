            <p>"This is not a moment, but a movement. #BlackLivesMatter was created in 2012 after Trayvon Martin's murderer, 
            George Zimmerman, was acquitted for his crime, and dead 17-year old Trayvon 
            was posthumously placed on trial for his own murder. Rooted in the experiences 
            of Black people in this country who actively resist our dehumanization, 
            #BlackLivesMatter is a call to action and a response to the virulent 
            anti-Black racism that permeates our society. Black Lives Matter is a 
            unique contribution that goes beyond extrajudicial killings of Black 
            people by police and vigilantes." (source: <a href="http://blacklivesmatter.com/" target="_blank">www.blacklivesmatter.com</a>)

                        agencies. For exmaple: England and Wales, with a population of 56.9 million people, had
                        55 fatal police shootings in 24 years. By contrast, the United States, with a population
                        of 316.1 million, suffered 55 fatal police shooting in the first 24 days of 2015.

                        in so-called legal intervention deaths in the U.S. between 2010 and 2014,

                        than that of whites. About 96 percent of the deaths overall resulted from 
                        shootings. The study examined information on 2,285 fatal encounters with 
                        police between 2010 and 2014. <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2016-12-21/black-males-nearly-3-times-more-likely-to-be-killed-by-police-than-whites"

                        black activists around the world modeled efforts for reform

                        Arab Spring</a>. This international movement 
                        has been referred to as the "Black Spring". Connections have also 
                        been forged with parallel international efforts such as the Dalit 
                        rights movement. Major protests have happened in Austrailia,
                        the United Kingdom, Canada and more.</p></td>
