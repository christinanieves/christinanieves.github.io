            <p>The Women's March was a worldwide protest on January 21, 2017, 
            to advocate legislation and policies regarding human rights and other issues, 
            including women's rights, immigration reform, healthcare reform, the natural 
            environment, LGBTQ rights, racial equality, freedom of religion, and workers' 
            rights. The rallies were aimed at Donald Trump, immediately following his 
            inauguration as President of the United States, 
            largely due to statements and positions attributed to him regarded by many 
            as anti-women or otherwise offensive. It was the largest single-day protest in U.S. history.
            Worldwide participation has been estimated at five million. (source:

                        many people as Trump's Inauguration. They 
                        analyzed photographs and video taken of the National Mall and vicinity 
                        and estimated that there were about 160,000 people in those areas in 
                        the hour leading up to Mr. Trump's speech.
                        They also estimated that at least 470,000 people were at the 
                        Women's March in Washington in and near 
                        the mall at about 2 p.m during the protest. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/22/us/politics/womens-march-trump-crowd-estimates.html?_r=0"

                        Black, indigenous and transgender women and girls, are kidnapped, trafficked,
